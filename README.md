This repository contains scripts and tools for visualizing and analyzing data using Python and various libraries. Below is an overview of the main components:

## 1. Distribution Graphs

### Plotting Distributions

In this section, we visualize the distribution of values in each column of the dataset. This helps to understand the frequency and spread of different values.

## 2. Correlation Matrix

### Visualizing Correlations

Here, we generate a correlation matrix to explore relationships between numerical variables in our dataset. This matrix provides insights into how strongly pairs of variables are related.

## 3. Scatter and Density Plots

### Scatter and Density Matrix

Finally, scatter and density plots are used to visualize pairwise relationships and distributions of numerical features. These plots offer a clear visual representation of relationships between variables.
